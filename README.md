### About South Park:
The animated television series South Park, co-created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, about four boys living in a dysfunctional Colorado mountain town, has won Emmy and Peabody awards. Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny manage to have fun despite regional and international tragedies, as well as interference from their parents and famous people. 
### About South Park Episode Deep Learning:
Stan Marsh, a fourth-grader, becomes dependent on the software to write both academic essays and romantic texts to his girlfriend Wendy Testaburger, which puts him in conflict with her, his classmates, and school administrators. The episode parodies the use of the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, which is acknowledged as a co-writer for the episode.
